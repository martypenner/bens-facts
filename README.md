# Ben's facts

This site is a silly experiment in managing costs with OpenAI by long-term caching results while experimenting with different cloud providers and architectures.

This thing has already been through a few rounds, namely navigating fly.io, railway, and vercel. The latest experiment is on AWS using SST. I'm going to wait a month or two to see how costs are handled.

I have to say: things are looking good architecturally already in that regard. I was somewhat forced to split this thing up into a monorepo to deal with SST binding issues, which is a good thing at this point. Time will tell.
